Blue Flight (2018) by Yirui Tian is a 2D animated film, which tells the story of a lonely man and captive fish who join forces to save one another. Overwhelmed and depressed by his urban existence, the man encounters a caged fish who awakens a mutual desire for freedom. The animation begins with a somber palette in tandem with hand drawn illustrations to create an dark world that ultimately gives way to an open and colorful ocean scene upon their release. A journey of self-awareness, Blue Flight encourages viewers to trust their emotions as they search for personal happiness.
