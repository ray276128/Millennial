title: Artist Statement
---

I believe that the process of growing up is ugly and painful. Although school, parents and society have taught me to be a good person, I find that the world does not always respond favorably to my good deeds. Sometimes life can be unfair and I find myself angry and disappointed. During those moments, I question my place in the world and struggle to overcome my negative feelings. 
	As an animator with a focus on narratives that convey emotional meaning, I find a release from my negative feelings within my fine art practice. The results can be seen in my use of metaphors to express abstract feelings shaped by color associations. In my film Fish Tail, I use colors to also express emotions, build characters and tell a story. The main color in my film is cold blue, which I use to show a lonely and depressed world. When my main character overcomes obstacles, the color of the animation’s world transforms to a warm red palette. By using color in the cinematic environment, I am able to visually indicate transitions within a narrative structure and deliver abstract, emotional and non-verbal associations through specific colors. As Hui Zhu, an associate professor at the Academy of Arts & Design at Tsinghua University has observed, “Yirui’s special artistic style is warm and interesting. It has the ability to heal the heart.” How true!  Through my distinctive and thoughtful color palette, my narrative animations overflow with emotions that touch both the heart and soul.
